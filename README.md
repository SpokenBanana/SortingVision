# SortingVision
A program that lets you visualize sorting algorithms. Inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg

I love programs that are very... "visual". I like to see things going on, so the video really appealed to me and I really
wanted to re-create it so I did!

Here we have merge sort in the middle of it's work!.

As of right now, I only have merge sort, bubble sort, and cocktail sort implemented.

I loved how this project turned out and I plan on adding more sorting algorithms to it in the future.

I really like how the cocktail sort animation looks, its like it gets more excited the closer it is to being sorted.
